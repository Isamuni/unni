# unni
unni is a Telegram Bot that gives info about events from sciabaca

**unni** is the Sicilian word for *where*. That is one of the main questions people ask about events: where is it? **unni**, however, provides more information about events than just where that happen. 

**unni** will serve the events data from [**sciabaca**](https://github.com/sic2/sciabaca). 

## commands

This is the list of commands supported by **unni**

- /help
- /today
- /future

We would love to have other commands, such as `/topic` or `/city`, in the future.
